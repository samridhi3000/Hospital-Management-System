# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A **Java-based Hospital Management System** developed as an academic project to manage core hospital operations such as patient records, doctor information, and appointment scheduling. The system uses a **menu-driven Command Line Interface (CLI)** and demonstrates strong use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Hospital Management System helps automate basic hospital workflows by reducing manual effort and organizing data efficiently. It allows users to manage patients, doctors, and appointments through a simple and interactive console-based interface.

This project was built to strengthen practical understanding of **Java, OOP, collections, and program structure**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Java
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Java Collections
* Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## 🧠 System Working (Flow Explanation)

1. The application starts by displaying a **main menu**.
2. The user selects an option:

   * Patient Management
   * Doctor Management
   * Appointment Scheduling
   * View Records
   * Exit
3. Based on the selection, the system performs the required operation.
4. After completion, control returns to the main menu.
5. The program exits safely when the user chooses the exit option.
